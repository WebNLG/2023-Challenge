# Data

We provide rough training data automatically translated from the original 2020 English set into the 3 target languages via a multilingual [NMT system](https://github.com/bzhangGo/zero/tree/master/docs/multilingual_laln_lalt). We also provide dev sets that have been manually translated into each target language by human translators.

The Breton development set (`br_dev.xml`) contains 1401 entries from the WebNLG 2020 English dev set that have each had one lexicalisation manually translated to Breton. These entries were randomly sampled while making sure to cover lexicalisations from all triple set size groups.

Language codes are as follows:
* Breton - `br`
* Welsh - `cy`
* Irish - `ga`
* Maltese - `mt`
